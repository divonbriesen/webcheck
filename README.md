# webcheck
For evalualating student work


## Assignment
- Build a simple webpage with a form that asks for the student ID.
- use JS to output that student ID to the screen.
- then write some code that confirms that that student's webspace is set up (in other words if students.cpcc.edu/~theirid returns successfully, then the webspace is setup.
- then move on to see if they setup a course folder (can check thru web110, web115, web120, web140, web215, web250) and provide checkbox for each
- check for template.htm or .html
- check for introduction.htm or .html
- check for contract.html or .html


# Proposed steps
- have a field that allows the user to paste in a bunch of id's separated by commas, and put them into an array
- loop thru that array and list out the url's
- make those url's clickable links
- establish that the webspace is created - so the url is valid : e.g. http://students.cpcc.edu/~userid
        - figure out how to get a return value from each
